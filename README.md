# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm a software developer with experience in various technologies. Currently, I work as a **Fullstack Developer** using **Next.js** and have over a year of experience in this field.

## Technologies I Use

- **TypeScript**: My primary programming language for daily development.
- **Next.js**: The framework I use for building modern web applications.
- **Java**: I completed a 2-month backend bootcamp using **Quarkus**.

## Work Experience

<!-- - **Backend Developer at PT Sarana Amal Indonesia**  
  *[Feb, 2025] - Present*  
  Building and maintaining backend services using Express, Hono, JavaScript, TypeScript, Nest.js, and Postgres. Occasionally, I tackle CMS projects with Angular (the classic v1, not the modern webapp) and Next.js (with shadcn). Successfully led a rapid rewrite of the BigAmal frontend ([bigamal.com](https://bigamal.com)) with Next.js in just one month. Spearheaded the migration of our Express codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript, wrangled a hefty pile of legacy code, and switched our runtime from Node.js to Bun for a snappier developer experience. -->

- **Fullstack Developer at GMJ Global Energy**  
  *[May, 2023] - [Nov, 2024]*
